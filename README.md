# Samuel Kuczynski Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this analysis was to help provide additioanl queries for Bobby's managers. We did a total of two more queries on our data where we determined the number of retiring employees per title along with identifying a list of individuals that are able to aprticipate in a mentorhsip program.


## Results

### * For the first deliverable of 'The Number of Retiring Employees by Title' we were able to identify that the majority of people retiring were engineers and senior staff. 
### * Due to the high levels of senior engineers and senior staff we will want to start targeting potential replacements for these individuals within the company, it will be much cheaper to promote within versus hiring outside of the company and re-training
### * For the second deliverable of the 'The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program' we were able to export the entire list of employees and their roles that are able to helpout with mentoring.
### * This information is very useful as we can now reach out to these employees individually to start gaguing the interest on them being mentors for their eventual replacements.  

## Summary

### "How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?'

#### This conversation is probably able to be had with more than looking at just the total amount of people retiring. I think a better analysis of this question would do better on speaking to the managers/directors of the individuals retiring to see if there is any room for combination of work. Maximizing headcount is a very important thing to constantly be looking at with companies and with a major retirement group it may give us the opportunity to actually look at if all of these jobs are necessary without having to layoff a ton of employees. Maybe we could look at combining some of these normal engineer roles into seniors by adding tasks to existing enginners and giving them a noticeable pay increase. Some of the queries you would want to look at for this would be pulling the amount of employees that would be under each manager and sending out a survey to each of them. 

### 'Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?'

####  For this query you are going to want to pull active employees for each department and compare that to the amount of retirement ready employees that would be willing to mentor the next generation. You would be able to do this by creating a query of active employees for each category and comparing that to the CSV file with the "retiring_titles" csv linked.
